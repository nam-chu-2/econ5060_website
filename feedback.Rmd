### Office Hours

I will holding my office hours on Mondays and Wednesdays from 4:20pm to 5:20pm. The zoom link can be found on the course syllabus. I would appreciate it if you email me at hoangnamchu@cmail.carleton.ca with your questions in advance so that I can prep beforehand. 

If those times do not work for you, please email me so that we can arrange something else. I am also happy to meet in-person on campus.
